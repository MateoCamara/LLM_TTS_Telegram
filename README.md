## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone This Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### Step 2: Clone OpenVoice Repository

Inside the root directory of this repository, clone the OpenVoice repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:myshell-ai/OpenVoice.git
```

Additionally, download the original voice model weights trained with OpenVoice from the following link:

[Download Voice Weights](https://myshell-public-repo-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/openvoice/checkpoints_v2_0417.zip)

Unzip them and store them in checkpoints/openvoice

### Step 3: Install Requirements

To install all necessary libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using a GPU, visit [PyTorch Official Site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the correct version of PyTorch for your CUDA version.

### Step 4: Download Language Dictionary

The OpenVoice version used requires a specific language dictionary. Download it with:

```bash
python -m unidic download
```

### Step 5: Download oLlama

Download oLlama from:

[Download oLlama](https://ollama.com/)

Important: Before running the code, start the oLlama program to ensure a language model server is running.

### Step 6: Setup Your Voice

Store a high-quality voice recording in the `resources` directory and reference it in the `setup_tts` function in the code.

### Step 7: Create Your Telegram Bot

Follow this comprehensive guide to create your Telegram bot:

[Telegram Bot Tutorial](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial)

Store your Telegram bot token in a `.env` file to keep it secure but accessible to your application.

### Step 8: Run the code!

```bash
python main.py
```

Now you should be able to talk to your Telegram bot!
